```
PM> Install-Package Imageflow.Net
PM> Install-Package Imageflow.NativeRuntime.win-x86 
PM> Install-Package Imageflow.NativeRuntime.win-x86_64-sandybridge 
PM> Install-Package Imageflow.NativeRuntime.osx_10_11-x86_64
PM> Install-Package Imageflow.NativeRuntime.ubuntu_14_04-x86_64 
```

Note: You must install the [appropriate NativeRuntime(s)](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Imageflow.NativeRuntime) in the project you are deploying - they have to copy imageflow.dll to the output folder. 

[NativeRuntimes](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Imageflow.NativeRuntime) that are suffixed with -sandybridge (2011, AVX support) or -haswell (2013, AVX2 support) require a CPU of that generation or later.
